# Connect-Four-Game-
A cool project I worked on during my vibe coding class which as its name suggests is a recreation of the connect four game. 

# Connect Four - Neo-Brutalist Edition

A complete frontend-only Connect Four game with an expressive AI opponent, comprehensive game history, and an in-app console. Built with vanilla JavaScript (ES modules) and a striking Neo-Brutalist aesthetic.

## Features

- **Neo-Brutalist UI**: Bold black outlines, hard shadows, and vibrant colors on an off-white background
- **Smooth Animations**: GPU-accelerated disc drops with bounce easing, pulsing win highlights, and fluid transitions
- **AI Opponent**: Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with an expressive face that reacts to game events
- **Game Modes**: Human vs AI (default) and Human vs Human (local)
- **Game History**: All games saved to localStorage with full replay capability
- **In-App Console**: Verbose logging of all game events with export functionality
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, colorblind mode, and high-contrast mode
- **Undo**: Undo last move during active games

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Keep Computer Awake While Server Runs

Prevent your computer from sleeping while the server is running:

```bash
# Option 1: Use npm script (simple)
npm run dev:awake

# Option 2: Use shell script (with auto-tunnel)
./start-with-tunnel.sh
```

Your computer will automatically stay awake and allow sleep again when you stop the server.

### Playing on the Same WiFi Network or Remotely

To allow others to play with you:

#### Option 1: Local Network (Same WiFi)
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Find your local IP address:
   - **Linux/Mac**: Run `hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`
   - **Windows**: Run `ipconfig` and look for "IPv4 Address"
3. Share the URL: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5173`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

**Note**: Make sure your firewall allows incoming connections on port 5173.

#### Option 2: Public Link (Works Anywhere)
For playing across different networks:

```bash
npm run dev
# In a new terminal:
npx localtunnel --port 5173
```

This generates a public URL (e.g., `https://xxxx.loca.lt`) that works from any device, anywhere in the world!

### Mobile Support

The game is fully optimized for mobile devices with:
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ✅ Touch-optimized controls (44px+ tap targets)
- ✅ Prevents accidental zoom and text selection
- ✅ Mobile-friendly modals and panels
- ✅ Works great on iPhone, Android, tablets

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## How It Works

### Game Play

1. **Starting a Game**: Click "New Game" to open a modal where you can choose:
   - Game mode (Human vs AI or Human vs Human)
   - Who starts first (Player or AI)
   - AI difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
   - Sound effects toggle (check to enable sound effects)

2. **Making Moves**:
   - **Mouse**: Click on any column to drop a disc
   - **Keyboard**: Use Left/Right arrows to navigate columns, Enter/Space to drop

3. **AI Behavior**:
   - **Easy**: Random valid moves
   - **Medium**: Greedy algorithm that prioritizes winning moves, blocking opponent wins, and center column preference
   - **Hard**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning (depth 4-6) for optimal play

4. **AI Face Emotions**:
   - 😐 Neutral: Start of game
   - 🤔 Thinking: During AI computation
   - 😄 Happy: On clever moves or when gaining advantage
   - 😤 Frustrated: When player blocks imminent win
   - 😎 Smug: When AI wins or is confident
   - 😢 Sad: When AI loses
   - 😶 Draw: On a tie game

### Console & History

- **Console**: Toggle the console panel to see all game events logged with timestamps, types, and optional metadata
- **Export Logs**: Click "Export Logs" to download all console entries as a text file
- **Game History**: All completed games are saved to localStorage. Access the history panel to view past games and replay them step-by-step

### Replay System

Replays show:
- Timeline of all moves with disc icons
- Current move highlight
- Controls: Play/Pause, Step Forward/Back, Speed adjustment (0.2× to 2×)
- Full board state restoration including AI face updates

## Technical Details

### Board Logic (`board.js`)

The board is represented as a 2D array `[ROWS][COLS]` where:
- `0` = empty cell
- `1` = Player 1 (Red)
- `2` = Player 2 / AI (Yellow)

Gravity is handled by `getLowestEmptyRow()` which finds the bottommost empty cell in a column. Win detection checks horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal directions from every possible starting position.

### AI Implementation (`ai.js`)

- **Easy**: Random selection from available moves
- **Medium**: Uses `evaluateBoard()` heuristic with greedy selection
- **Hard**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning, depth configurable (default 4-5 to prevent UI freeze)

The AI includes a simulated thinking delay (500-1000ms) and updates its face during computation.

### UI Rendering (`ui.js`)

Uses SVG for crisp, scalable rendering. Discs are animated using CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated) to avoid layout reflow. Column click zones are precisely mapped to avoid mis-registered clicks.

### History Storage (`history.js`)

Games are stored in localStorage under key `connectFourHistory_v1`. Each game record includes:
- Unique ID, timestamp, mode, difficulty, player order
- Array of moves with board snapshots
- Final board state and winner

## Accessibility

- Full keyboard navigation (Left/Right/Enter/Space)
- ARIA labels and live regions for screen readers
- Colorblind mode with alternate color palette
- High-contrast mode toggle
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements

## Browser Support

Modern browsers with ES module support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - recent versions).
